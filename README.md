# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
I was hired by Tom with the Colorado Board of Elections to complete 	the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1.	 Calculate the total number of votes cast.	
2.	 Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	 Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4.	 Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6.	Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7.	Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
8.	Determine the county with the highest voter turnout.

## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Challenge Summary
Thank you for the opportunity to work with you.  The analysis above could be applied to other elections not just at the local congressional election.  With modifications to the code, you could run this same analysis on the local level for your mayoral elections and at the state level for election of the governor.  Instead of just tracking voters at the county level, you could further track the by city or municipality and even further by school district.
